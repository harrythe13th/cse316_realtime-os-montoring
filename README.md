# Real Time Process Monitoring Dashboard

# **Project Overview**

## **Goals**
The **Resource Monitoring Dashboard** aims to provide real-time insights into system resource usage. It helps users monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network performance efficiently through a user-friendly interface.

## **Expected Outcomes**
* A dashboard displaying real-time system metrics.
* Search and filter functionalities to analyze resource usage trends.
* The ability to terminate resource-intensive processes directly from the dashboard.

## **Scope**
* **Monitoring**: Tracks CPU, RAM, disk, and network usage.
* **Data Visualization**: Presents metrics in an understandable format using graphs and charts.
* **Process Control**: Enables users to find and terminate resource-heavy processes.
